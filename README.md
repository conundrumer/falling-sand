Color Wire
==========

the repo is called "falling sand" bc i was originally gonna make a clone of that but then decided to do a digital circuit simulator instead

rules: red inverts green, green inverts blue, blue inverts red, grey wires transmit signals with no inversions, on wires override off wires

this makes color wire turing complete without the crazy timing synchronization you have to do in conway's game of life and wireworld
